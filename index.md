<h1><b>Deep Learning for Content-based Image Retrieval</b></h1>
This was my final year project of BScIMT. AIs were trained with TensorFlow in Python. This project applied deep learning on content-based image retrieval by extracting features from fine-tuned VGG16 and fine-tuned ResNet50. It was found that fine-tuned ResNet50 was a better image descriptor than fine-tuned VGG16.
